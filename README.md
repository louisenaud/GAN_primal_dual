# Primal Dual GAN optimization - WIP

## Description
This code is the set of experiements to illustrate how we can train at GAN with the Primal-Dual Optimization framework.

## Dependencies
This code is written in Python 2.7, and you will need the following packages:
* Pytorch
* Matplotlib
* Scipy (for multivariate gaussian)
* Numpy

##  Example: 1D Gaussian

##  Example: 2D Gaussian
